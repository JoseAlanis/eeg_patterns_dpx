abstract: |
  Cognitive control encompasses a set of basic perceptual and reasoning
  processes that help us align thoughts and actions with goals.
  While a growing body of research indicates that these processes can be
  independently engaged and tuned to fit different tasks (e.g.,
  behavioural preparation vs behavioural adaptation), the dynamic interplay of
  these processes and their functional timing within the information stream,
  remains elusive. In this study, we used a combination of mass-univariate and
  multivariate pattern analysis to examine electroencephalography data from 52
  participants, recorded during performance of the Dot Pattern Expectancy Task
  (DPX), a task designed to assess both preparatory and adaptive cognitive
  control. Contrary to the notion of isolated neural signatures for either
  cognitive control mode, our data indicates that cognitive control engages a
  sequence of distinct yet partially overlapping brain activation patterns.
  Preparatory cue-stimuli evoked early transient occipital-parietal amplitude
  responses that were followed by enhanced sustained central-parietal and
  fronto-central amplitude responses. Similarly, adaptive probe-stimuli evoked
  enhanced early transient occipital-parietal amplitude responses, but these
  were followed by enhanced transient, fronto-central and central parietal
  amplitude responses. Moreover, we found significant relationships between
  the magnitude of the central-parietal and fronto-central amplitude response
  pattern and behavioural performance in the DPX. This research not only
  extends prior work but also offers valuable insights into the functional
  timing and organisation of the neurocognitive processes underpinning both
  preparatory and adaptive cognitive control.

## Participants

## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis

We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.

# Results

## Evoked amplitude response

We analysed evoked amplitude response patterns using a two-level hierarchical
mass univariate analysis approach. Condition effects were estimated on
single-trial data from each subject and then compared across subjects
to assess significance (see Methods, mass univariate analysis).

### Cue stimuli

```{r format-cue-evoked-activity, message = FALSE}
# n subjects and error dfs
N <- 52

# early effects
early_negative <- report.t.values(cue_peaks, N, time = 'early', polarity = 'negative')
early_positive <- report.t.values(cue_peaks, N, time = 'early', polarity = 'positive')

# mid range effects
mid_positive <- report.t.values(cue_peaks, N, time = 'midrange', polarity = 'positive')
mid_negative <- report.t.values(cue_peaks, N, time = 'midrange', polarity = 'negative')

# late/later effects
late_negative <- report.t.values(cue_peaks, N, time = 'late', polarity = 'negative')
later_negative <- report.t.values(cue_peaks, N, time = 'later', polarity = 'negative')
```

As depicted in Figure 3, analysis of the cue evoked activity revealed
significant differences between responses elicited by the cue stimuli
(i.e., cues "A" and "B"). The earliest differences emerged at approximately 
180 to 250 ms post-cue. In this time window, "B" cues elicited a stronger 
negative polarisation of the evoked amplitude response at parietal and occipital 
sensors compared to "A" cues. The peak of this effect was observed at channel 
`r early_negative$channel` at approximately `r early_negative$time` ms 
post-stimulus (`r early_negative$t`, `r early_negative$d`, `r early_negative$dci`); 
see Figures 4a and 4d). "B" cues also showed a more pronounced positive amplitude 
response at frontal sensors during the same time window compared to "A" cues (peak at channel 
`r early_positive$channel` at approximately `r early_positive$time` ms post-cue,
`r early_positive$t`, `r early_positive$d`, `r early_positive$dci`).

amplitude response.
\newline

A second cluster of differences extended from approximately 400 to 750 ms post-cue.
During this time window, "B" cues showed a stronger positive polarisation of
the evoked amplitude response at parietal sensors compared to "A" cues.
The peak of this effect was observed at channel `r mid_positive$channel`
at approximately `r mid_positive$time` ms post-stimulus
(`r mid_positive$t`, `r mid_positive$d`, `r mid_positive$dci`; see Figures 4a and 4d).
"B" cues also showed a more pronounced negative response at occipital sensors during the
same time window compared to "A" cues. This effect reached its peak at channel `r mid_negative$channel`
at approximately `r mid_negative$time` ms post-cue (`r mid_negative$t`,
`r mid_negative$d`, `r mid_negative$dci`).

Finally, the analysis revealed two smaller clusters of differences at approximately 
`r late_negative$time` ms and `r later_negative$time` ms post-cue. During these time
windows, "B" cues elicited a more negative amplitude response at fronto-central
sensors compared to "A" cues at channel `r late_negative$channel` 
(`r later_negative$t`, `r later_negative$d`, `r later_negative$dci`; 
see Figure 4c and Figure 4f).

### Probe stmuli

```{r format-probe-evoked-activity, message = FALSE}
# n subjects and error dfs
N <- 52

# early effects
ay_ax_early_negative <- report.t.values(AY_AX_peaks, N, time = 'early', polarity = 'negative')
ay_ax_early_positive <- report.t.values(AY_AX_peaks, N, time = 'early', polarity = 'positive')

# mid range effects
ay_ax_mid_positive <- report.t.values(AY_AX_peaks, N, time = 'midrange', polarity = 'positive')
ay_ax_mid_negative <- report.t.values(AY_AX_peaks, N, time = 'midrange', polarity = 'negative')

# late/later effects
ay_ax_late_positive <- report.t.values(AY_AX_peaks, N, time = 'late', polarity = 'positive')
ay_ax_late_negative <- report.t.values(AY_AX_peaks, N, time = 'late', polarity = 'negative')
```

Similarly, we found significant differences in the amplitude responses
elicited by "X" and "Y" probes when they were presented after an "A" cue
(i.e., between "AX" and "AY" cue-probe pairs). As shown in figure 5, the earliest 
differences emerged at approximately 180 to 250 ms post-porbe. In this time window, 
"Y" probes showed a stronger negative polarisation of the evoked amplitude response at
parietal and occipital sensors compared to "X" probes. The peak of this effect
occurred at channel `r ay_ax_early_negative$channel` at approximately
`r ay_ax_early_negative$time` ms post-stimulus (`r ay_ax_early_negative$t`,
`r ay_ax_early_negative$d`, `r ay_ax_early_negative$dci`).
Moreover, "Y" probes elicited a more pronounced positive
amplitude response at left frontal sensors compared to "X" probes during the
same time window. The peak of this response was observed at
sensor `r ay_ax_early_positive$channel` at approximately
`r ay_ax_early_positive$time` ms post-stimulus (`r ay_ax_early_positive$t`,
`r ay_ax_early_positive$d`, `r ay_ax_early_positive$dci`).

A second cluster of differences spanned from approximately 
300 to 400 ms following the probe presentation. During this period, 
"Y" probes elicited a stronger positive polarisation of the evoked amplitude response
at fronto-central sensors. The peak of this effect was observed at sensor
`r ay_ax_mid_positive$channel` at approximately `r ay_ax_mid_positive$time` ms 
post-stimulus (`r ay_ax_mid_positive$t`, `r ay_ax_mid_positive$d`, 
`r ay_ax_mid_positive$dci`). "Y" probes also elicited a 
more pronounced positive negative response at left occipital sensors (peak at 
`r ay_ax_mid_negative$channel` at approximately `r ay_ax_mid_negative$time` ms) compared to 
"X" probes during the same time window (`r ay_ax_mid_negative$t`, `r ay_ax_mid_negative$d`, 
`r ay_ax_mid_negative$dci`).

The analysis revealed a third cluster of differences spanning from approximately 
450 to 750 ms after the probe presentation. Within this time window, 
"Y" probes exhibited a more positive amplitude response 
at parietal sensors. The peak of this effect was observed at 
`r ay_ax_late_positive$channel` at approximately `r ay_ax_late_positive$time` ms 
(`r ay_ax_late_positive$t`, `r ay_ax_late_positive$d`, `r ay_ax_late_positive$dci`).
